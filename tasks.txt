1. Found all cameras
2. Read possible properties and create property-mapper
3. Read settings bars -> create sequence of commands (can save commands in queue and then call method that execute all commands)
4. Go to the rec mode. Can use two ways:
    a - with execwait and switch_mode(1)
    b - with populate all cams, cmdwait and exit from multimode
5. If I have different cameras, I should execte commands with execwait, because different cameras has different code of same properties
6. After set settings I should make shooting from all cameras (two possile ways)
7. Download last images from cameras
